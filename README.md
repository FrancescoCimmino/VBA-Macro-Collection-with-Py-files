# A Collection of useful VBA Macro
this small collection of even smaller project is both an experiment on how to use GitHub and an attempt to create a library of such tools


#1 - CopyFromFolderToFolder (.xlm)
  This VBA Macro copy files with specified names from column A (cell A2 down) from a selected folder to another, specified folder. if a file is not found, let's say, in column A, row 42, in column B row 42 will appear "missing" 

I use it at work and works properly


#1b - CopyFromFolderToFolder.py
  same as above but python script (works with an external excel file)
